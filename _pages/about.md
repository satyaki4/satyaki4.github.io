Hello and welcome! I am Satyaki Chakravarty, Ph.D. Candidate at the Department of Economics, University of North Carolina at Greensboro. I am on the AEA and EJME 2022-23, and available for interviews.

I am passionate about the economics of innovation, and particularly patents. My job market paper studies the patenting activity of small entities before and after the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act (AIA) of 2011.

Thank you very much for dropping by!
