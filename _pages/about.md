Hello! I am a Ph.D. Candidate at the Department of Economics, University of North Carolina at Greensboro and a visiting Assistant Professor at Elon University. I will be on the job market this Fall --- 2023-24, and will be available for interviews at the AEA, AOM, and EJME.

I have two passions --- teaching the fundamentals of economics and researching the economics of innovation. My job market paper studies the patenting activity of small entities before and after the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act (AIA) of 2011.

Click [**here**](https://satyaki4.github.io/files/JMP_satyaki.pdf) for the paper. My research and teaching statements can be accessed from their respective tabs.

Thank you very much for dropping by!
