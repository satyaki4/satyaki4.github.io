Hello! I am Satyaki Chakravarty, Ph.D. Candidate at the Department of Economics, University of North Carolina at Greensboro. I am on the American and European Job Market for the session of 2022-23. My job market paper studies the patenting activity of small entities before and after the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act (AIA) of 2011.
