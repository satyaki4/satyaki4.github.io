## Job Market Paper

**America Invents Act and innovation by small entities**. 2022.
<br/><small>[Draft](https://satyaki4.github.io/files/JMP_satyaki.pdf)</small><br>
<small>
This paper studies patenting activity by small U.S. entities before and after the passage of the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act (AIA) of 2011 which changed the patenting rule in the United States from a first-to-invent to a first-inventor-to-file. The AIA's goals were to encourage patenting and provide certainty by curbing litigation. Contrary to the AIA's intentions, the results indicate a decline in patenting activity post-AIA for all entities, and a widened gap between the small and large entities when compared to the pre-AIA period. Moreover, entities with a greater exposure to litigation drop their patenting activity as compared to the entities with a lower exposure, and among the exposed, the small entities report a further drop in their activity. Prior to the AIA, entities had the benefit of flexibility on when to file for patents but this benefit came at a cost; it created uncertainty in an atmosphere of litigative behavior about the date of the invention. To check litigation, the AIA encouraged early disclosure of inventions, but this added to the already constrained budget of the small entities. This paper contributes in the following way: first, studies the effects of the AIA on small entities and empirically tests its predictions laid out prior to the legislation's enactment, and second, adds clarity to the understanding of the costs and benefits that the smaller entities face while innovating and their differences with the larger entities.

**Patents' time to grant - A study of China and India**. 2019.

China and India reported highest growth in high-tech exports for the past two decades (World Bank) and hence are increasingly becoming the countries to file for protection of intellectual property. This paper examines whether there is a delay in time to grant of a patent when applied by domestic versus foreign applicants in China and India. A delay in time to grant on the basis of nationality violates the TRIPs agreement. Further, delay in grant of a patent generates dead-weight loss for the society, hence effectively deterring future innovation. The results show that China delays foreign patents, however India does exactly the opposite, indicating that there is a significant variation in patent examination times across applicant characteristics, technology fields and countries. Thus invisible trade barriers do exist in these markets. Applicants can use the details in this paper and plan their filing strategies, e.g. taking into account average grant lag.
