### America Invents Act and innovation by small entities. 2022.

<small>
This paper studies patenting activity by small U.S. entities before and after the passage of the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act (AIA) of 2011. The AIA changed the patenting rule in the United States from a first-to-invent to a first-inventor-to-file. Previously, entities had the benefit of flexibility on when to file for patents but this benefit came at a cost; it created uncertainty in an atmosphere of litigative behavior about the date of the invention. Using the patent-level statistics from the patent applications filed at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), this paper estimates the change in patenting activity post-AIA. Contrary to the AIA's intended effects of encouraging invention disclosure, the results indicate its decline post-AIA for all entities, and among them, a relative decline for the small entities compared to all the entities pre-AIA. But, among the small entities, the first-time small entities on average significantly increased the quantity and quality of their inventions post-AIA compared to all the entities pre-AIA. This paper adds nuance to the predictions on patenting activity derived for the AIA from an AIA-like reform in Canada, where patenting activity skewed towards the large entities from the small entities after the reform.

### Patents' time to grant - A study of China and India. 2019.

China and India reported highest growth in high-tech exports for the past two decades (World Bank) and hence are increasingly becoming the countries to file for protection of intellectual property. This paper examines whether there is a delay in time to grant of a patent when applied by domestic versus foreign applicants in China and India. A delay in time to grant on the basis of nationality violates the TRIPs agreement. Further, delay in grant of a patent generates dead-weight loss for the society, hence effectively deterring future innovation. The results show that China delays foreign patents, however India does exactly the opposite, indicating that there is a significant variation in patent examination times across applicant characteristics, technology fields and countries. Thus invisible trade barriers do exist in these markets. Applicants can use the details in this paper and plan their filing strategies, e.g. taking into account average grant lag.
