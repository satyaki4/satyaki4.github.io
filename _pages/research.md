### America Invents Act and innovation by small entities. 2022.

<br/><small>
*Abstract*: This paper studies patenting activity by small U.S. entities before and after the passage of the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act (AIA) of 2011. The AIA changed the patenting rule in the United States from a first-to-invent to a first-inventor-to-file. Previously, entities had the benefit of flexibility on when to file for patents but this benefit came at a cost; it created uncertainty in an atmosphere of litigative behavior about the date of the invention. Using the patent-level statistics from the patent applications filed at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), this paper estimates the change in patenting activity post-AIA. Contrary to the AIA's intended effects of encouraging invention disclosure, the results indicate its decline post-AIA for all entities, and among them, a relative decline for the small entities compared to all the entities pre-AIA. But, among the small entities, the first-time small entities on average significantly increased the quantity and quality of their inventions post-AIA compared to all the entities pre-AIA. This paper adds nuance to the predictions on patenting activity derived for the AIA from an AIA-like reform in Canada, where patenting activity skewed towards the large entities from the small entities after the reform.
